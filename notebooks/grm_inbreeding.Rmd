# Notes & qurestions

* Aguilar et al. 2020
    + "It can be seen that ignoring inbreeding in Henderson's rules results in higher self-relationships, thus implicitly assuming animals to be inbred"
    + "For SSGBLUP, ignoring inbreeding in the set-up of A−1 not only generates wrong diagonal elements for A*, but also modifies diagonal elements for genotyped individuals in H∗"
    + "It can be seen that ignoring inbreeding systematically underestimates reliability in BLUP while in SSGBLUP there is over and underestimation of reliability"

## Reliabilities from `fixed9` model using pedigree-based inbreeding coefficient

### All animals in the pedigree

```{r}
fixed9_ped_inb %>% 
  summarise(`Min. reliability` = min(acc),
            `Mean reliability` = mean(acc),
            `Max. reliability` = max(acc))
  
```

```{r}
fixed9_ped_inb %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = acc)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Reliability",
       y = "Count")
```

### Genotyped animals only 

```{r}
fixed9_ped_inb %>% 
  filter(full_reg %in% fixed9_genomic_inb$full_reg) %>% 
  summarise(`Min. reliability` = min(acc),
            `Mean reliability` = mean(acc),
            `Max. reliability` = max(acc))
  
```

```{r}
fixed9_ped_inb %>% 
  filter(full_reg %in% fixed9_genomic_inb$full_reg) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = acc)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20) +
  theme_classic() +
  labs(x = "Reliability",
       y = "Count")
```

# Negative reliabilities?

Seven individuals end up with negative accuracies using pedigree-based estimates of inbreeding. Upon further inspection, realized that they have extremely high genomic inbreeding estimates. They aren't in the breed comp file ASA sent for some reason, but based on the Herdbook website they all appear to be Bos indicus composites or 100% Bos indicus.
